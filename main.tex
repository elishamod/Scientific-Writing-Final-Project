\section{Introduction} 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item ChatGPT was introduced in Dec 2023 -- a revolutionary LLM.
    \item Since then, many other LLMs similar in capabilities have appeared.
    \item These LLMs are widely used for writing and coding.
    \item Some previous works analyzed abstracts and found an increase in certain words.
    \item We want to see if this effect can be observed in astrophysics
    \item Are the different branches in astro affected differently?
    \item Is there a marked difference between astro and other fields in physics?
\end{enumerate}


\section{Methods}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A list of words that are commonly cited as overused by LLMs.
    \item We collect our data using the arXiv API.
    \item Due to API limitations, we take 250 (or less) articles per month.
    \item We bin the data by yearly quarters.
    \item To see if usage has significantly changed since ChatGPT, we apply a z-test on word frequency before and after.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results}
