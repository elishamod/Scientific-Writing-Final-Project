\section{Introduction} 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item ChatGPT was introduced in Dec 2023 -- a revolutionary LLM.
    \item Since then, many other LLMs similar in capabilities have appeared.
    \item These LLMs are widely used for writing and coding.
    \item Some previous works analyzed abstracts and found an increase in certain words.
    \item We want to see if this effect can be observed in astrophysics
    \item Are the different branches in astro affected differently?
    \item Is there a marked difference between astro and other fields in physics?
\end{enumerate}

% make the list into a full introduction text
ChatGPT was introduced in December 2023 by OpenAI as a revolutionary large language model (LLM), capable of understanding and generating human-like text \cite{Roumeliotis2023}.
Since its release, many other LLMs with similar capabilities have emerged, and these models are now widely used for various tasks, including writing and coding.


\section{Methods}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A list of words that are commonly cited as overused by LLMs.
    \item We collect our data using the arXiv API.
    \item Due to API limitations, we take 250 (or less) articles per month.
    \item We bin the data by yearly quarters.
    \item To see if usage has significantly changed since ChatGPT, we apply a z-test on word frequency before and after.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results}

\caption{Factor increase in word usage after the introduction of ChatGPT, by arXiv category.
Blank cells indicate non-significant changes ($p \geq 0.05$).
The color scale indicates the magnitude of the factor increase, with darker yellow representing larger increases.}
